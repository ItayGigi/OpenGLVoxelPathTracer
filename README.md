# Unnamed Voxel Path Tracer Engine
A real-time voxel path-tracer using a fast DDA voxel traversal algorithm and spatiotemporal denoising.

## Scene Structure
The scene consists of low level 8x8x8 voxel grids called 'bricks' and a high level 'brick map' grid that specifies which brick to use in each cell.
